Welcome to to custom sticky header example

I am using waypoints for a custom sticky header/nav example

Functional Spec:
Header should stick to bottom of client window when landing on page.
When scrolling down, the header should remain fixed.
Once first image has become fully visible, header should stop sticking to the bottom and continue moving with the scroll.
Once the header hits the top of client viewport it will then stick to the top.
